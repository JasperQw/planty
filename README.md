# Planty

A new Flutter project.

Introducing Planty: a groundbreaking mobile app designed to transform farming and gardening by blending advanced technology with practical advice. Our goal is to help everyone, especially young farmers, learn and succeed in growing crops and managing green spaces.

Planty's core features offer real-time weather updates, tailored to your location, ensuring your plants thrive in the best conditions. We also provide tips to protect crops during extreme weather, like floods or droughts.

For those looking for more in-depth monitoring, our subscription service offers IoT Sensors Feedback, giving automated data on soil conditions like pH and moisture. Plus, our Agricultural Drone Thermal Image Feedback pinpoints issues like water stress or pests.

But we're not just about data â€“ Planty automates irrigation and fertigation, saving you time and resources. And our pest and disease detection tools use advanced technology to catch problems early.

Beyond that, Planty is a community hub. Connect with other farmers on social media, trade resources in our Marketplace, and get personalized advice and predictions for your crops.

Aligned with National Agro Policy 2.0, Planty promotes technology and sustainability in agriculture. We're here to support farmers and gardeners every step of the way. Join Planty today and grow smarter, together.
